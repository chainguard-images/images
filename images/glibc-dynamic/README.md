# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Base image with just enough to run arbitrary glibc binaries.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes
This image is meant to be used as just a base image only. It does not contain any programs that can be run, other than `/sbin/ldconfig`. Unlike Chainguard's standard `glibc` container image, the `glibc-dynamic` image also includes `libstdc++`, the GNU C++ standard library implementation.

You must bring your own artifacts to use this image, e.g. with a Docker multi-stage build. If you want locale support other than `C.UTF-8`, you must bring your own locale data as well. This may change in the future based on user feedback.

## Getting Started

To illustrate how you can use Chainguard's `glibc-dynamic` container image, start by creating the following Go program:

```shell
cat > main.go <<EOF
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.Get("http://www.google.com")
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
EOF
```

This is a `Hello, world!` program, but it includes the line `http.Get("http://www.google.com")` which will require glibc.

Next, create a Dockerfile that uses the Chainguard `glibc-dynamic` container as a base image:

```shell
cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
ADD main.go .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o /tmp/foo main.go

# Use this image as a base image.
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=builder /tmp/foo /foo
ENTRYPOINT ["/foo"]
EOF
```

Using this Dockerfile, build an image:

```shell
docker build -t glibc-dynamic-example .
```

Then run the newly-built image:

```shell
docker run --rm glibc-dynamic-example
```

This will return the following output, indicating the program was run successfully and the `glibc-dynamic` base image worked as expected:

```
Hello, world!
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
