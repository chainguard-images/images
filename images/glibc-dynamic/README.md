# Chainguard Container for glibc-dynamic

Base image with just enough to run arbitrary glibc binaries.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/glibc-dynamic:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes
This image is meant to be used as just a base image only. It does not contain any programs that can be run, other than `/sbin/ldconfig`. Unlike Chainguard's standard `glibc` container image, the `glibc-dynamic` image also includes `libstdc++`, the GNU C++ standard library implementation.

You must bring your own artifacts to use this image, e.g. with a Docker multi-stage build. If you want locale support other than `C.UTF-8`, you must bring your own locale data as well. This may change in the future based on user feedback.

## Getting Started

To illustrate how you can use Chainguard's `glibc-dynamic` container image, start by creating the following Go program:

```shell
cat > main.go <<EOF
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.Get("http://www.google.com")
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
EOF
```

This is a `Hello, world!` program, but it includes the line `http.Get("http://www.google.com")` which will require glibc.

Next, create a Dockerfile that uses the Chainguard `glibc-dynamic` container as a base image:

```shell
cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
ADD main.go .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o /tmp/foo main.go

# Use this image as a base image.
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=builder /tmp/foo /foo
ENTRYPOINT ["/foo"]
EOF
```

Using this Dockerfile, build an image:

```shell
docker build -t glibc-dynamic-example .
```

Then run the newly-built image:

```shell
docker run --rm glibc-dynamic-example
```

This will return the following output, indicating the program was run successfully and the `glibc-dynamic` base image worked as expected:

```
Hello, world!
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/containers?utm_source=readmes) are minimal container images that are secure by default. 

In many cases, the Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Containers are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with a `-dev` variant.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to leverage the `-dev` variants, copying application artifacts into a final minimal container that offers a reduced attack surface that wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.
