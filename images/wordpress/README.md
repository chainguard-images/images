# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimalist Wolfi-based WordPress images.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

<!--body:start-->
This image was designed to work as a drop-in replacement for the official [WordPress FPM-Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress) image, with a distroless variant for increased security on production environments. 

The `latest-dev` variant should be used to install and customize WordPress with themes and plugins. It has the same features from the upstream WordPress image, with an entrypoint script to set up the database via environment variables. The `latest` variant is a production-ready distroless image that should be used to run the WordPress site in a multi-stage build.

### Example Docker Compose Setup

You can use the following `docker-compose.yml` file to set up a **development environment** to install and customize WordPress:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/wordpress:latest-dev
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mariadb
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wp-user
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wp-password
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    volumes:
      - document-root:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - wolfi

  nginx:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:8080
    volumes:
      - document-root:/var/www/html
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    networks:
      - wolfi

  mariadb:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MARIADB_ALLOW_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD: 1
      MARIADB_USER: wp-user
      MARIADB_PASSWORD: wp-password
      MARIADB_DATABASE: wordpress
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    networks:
      - wolfi

networks:
  wolfi:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  document-root:
```

For this setup to work, you'll need an `nginx.conf` file with the following content:

```nginx
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    server {
        listen 8080;
        index index.php index.html;
        root /var/www/html;
        charset utf-8;
        client_max_body_size 100M;
        timeout 300;

        location / {
            include  /etc/nginx/mime.types;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
        location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_pass app:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        }

        location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
            deny all;
        }
    }
}

```

After running `docker compose up`, your WordPress site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can follow the installation instructions to set up your site and test your setup, but persisting customizations such as themes and plugins will require a different strategy that requires either setting up a volume for your theme and plugins or copying the custom content to the image through a Dockerfile that uses `cgr.dev/chainguard/wordpress:latest-dev` as the base image.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
