## Compatibility Notes

The Chainguard PHP Image is comparable to the [official PHP Image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/php). However, the Chainguard image does not run as the root user and contains only the minimum set of tools and dependencies needed to function. This means it doesn't include things like a shell or a package manager.

Because PHP applications typically require the installation of third-party dependencies with Composer, using a fully distroless image for building your application would not work. In cases like this, it's recommended that you implement a [multi-stage Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) that uses one of the PHP image's `-dev` variants to set up the application.

Note that chainguard also offers a `php:latest-fpm` image. This is the distroless `php-fpm` image variant, designed to be used together with our [Nginx](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/nginx/overview) image.


## Getting Started

To better understand how you can work with the Chainguard PHP image, we encourage you to check out our guide on [getting started with PHP](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started/php/). This resource demonstrates how you can use Chainguard's PHP Image to set up a distroless container image as a runtime to execute a command-line PHP application.

When creating a Dockerfile to extend Chainguard's PHP images, the recommended approach is to set up a multi-stage build so that you're able to install your Composer dependencies on a separate environment and then copy the files over to a smaller production image.


### Command-line Scripts and Applications

The following example demonstrates how to set up a multi-stage Dockerfile build in the context of command-line PHP applications:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-dev AS builder
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && \
    composer install --no-progress --no-dev --prefer-dist

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest
COPY --from=builder /app /app

ENTRYPOINT [ "php", "/app/command" ]
```

### Web Applications and APIs

For web applications, you should follow the same principle, but using the `php-fpm` variant for the final image. You'll also need a custom `nginx.conf` file to set up your Nginx service with PHP-FPM.

A good way to test your setup locally is by using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/). The following `docker-compose.yaml` file demonstrates how to create a web server environment using the [Nginx Chainguard Image](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/nginx/overview):

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  app:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-fpm
    restart: unless-stopped
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    networks:
      - wolfi

  nginx:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:80
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    networks:
      - wolfi

networks:
  wolfi:
    driver: bridge
```

Notice that the Nginx service has a volume share to set up a custom config file. The following `nginx.conf` file sets up Nginx to serve pages from an `/app/public` folder and redirects requests to `.php` files to the `app` service on port `9000`.

```php
events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        index index.php index.html;
        root /app/public;
        location ~ \.php$ {
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_pass app:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        }
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
            gzip_static on;
        }
    }
}
```


## Configuration

To install application dependencies from your host machine, you can use the `latest-dev` variant with a shared volume:

```shell
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/work --entrypoint composer --user root \
    cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-dev \
    install --working-dir=/work
```

To obtain information about modules available for the Chainguard PHP image, you can run the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --entrypoint php cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest -m
```

To obtain detailed information about the environment, you can run a `php --info` command on any of the image tags and use `grep` to look for a specific module or extension.

For instance, to check for `curl` settings, you can run:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest --info | grep curl
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
