Minimalist Wolfi-based [Valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) image.

Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that supports a variety workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary database. Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster, with options for replication and high availability.

The data model is key-value, but many different kind of values are supported: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, Streams, HyperLogLogs, Bitmaps.

- [Provenance Information](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/valkey/provenance_info/)

## Valkey Version
This will automatically pull the image to your local system and execute the command `valkey --version`:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/valkey --version
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
valkey server v=7.0.8 sha=00000000:0 malloc=libc bits=64 build=736cb94cbb0b299
```

## Using Valkey

The default Valkey port is 6379.
To run with Docker using default configuration:

```sh
docker run -p 6379:6379 --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/valkey

To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.

## Users and Directories

By default this image runs as a non-root user named `valkey` with a uid of 65532.
Valkey does not have a default data directory, it defaults to whatever the working directory is for the process.
We provide a default `WORKDIR` of `/data` that is writeable by the `valkey` user.

If you supply a different configuration file or change the user, UID, or `WORKDIR`, you'll need to ensure the user running the valkey process has permissions to write to that directory.

When running in Docker using a volume, that should also be taken care of automatically.
Here's an example of using a host volume:

```
% docker run -d -v $(pwd):/data -p 6379:6379 cgr.dev/chainguard/valkey
d029bfb291c7a00618342ab26702dc3788cfda24b85208de04464ccb06681797
$ valkey-cli set foo bar
OK
$ valkey-cli save
OK
$ valkey-cli get foo
"bar"
$ docker kill d029bfb291c7a00618342ab26702dc3788cfda24b85208de04464ccb06681797
d029bfb291c7a00618342ab26702dc3788cfda24b85208de04464ccb06681797
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd):/data -p 6379:6379 cgr.dev/chainguard/valkey
29845f88b862d8e337cf8183e8fb6ac1bd9b43c4ec2de37111bfe08b227e1caa
$ valkey-cli get foo
"bar"
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
