## Get It!

docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/ruby:latest
```
<!--getting:end-->

## Usage

Ruby applications typically require the installation of third-party dependencies through [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/). This means that using a fully distroless image for building your application would not work, as these do not include a package manager. In cases like this, youâ€™ll need to implement a multi-stage Docker build that uses one of Chainguard's `-dev` Image variants to set up the application.

We encourage you to check out our guide on [getting started with Ruby](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started/getting-started-ruby/) which demonstrates how you can use Chainguard's Ruby Image in both single- and multi-stage builds.
