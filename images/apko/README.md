## Build

This image is built with [apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko) and
[melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange) tooling.

## Signing

All distroless images are signed using [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/). This can be verified
using the [cosign](https://github.com/SigStore/cosign) tool:

```
$ COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify distroless.dev/apko | jq

Verification for distroless.dev/apko:latest --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.
