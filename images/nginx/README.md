## Compatibility Notes

Chainguard's `nginx` container image is comparable to both the `latest` and `alpine` versions of the [official nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) and, wherever possible, the Chainguard Container's configuration will align with the official image. However, Chainguard Images are built to be as minimal as possible, requiring a specific set of changes, which are outlined here.

Note: just as with the [official nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx), the `latest` tag will always be an Nginx `mainline` rather than `stable` release.

### Users

The official Docker image starts as the root user and forks to a less privileged user. By contrast, the Chainguard `nginx` Container starts as a less privileged user named `nginx` and no forking is required. 

Also note that the default `nginx` configuration file includes a user directive that will run the `nginx` process as the `nginx` user. See the following section on custom server blocks for more information.

### Default port

The default port for the `nginx` Chainguard Container is `8080`, rather than `80`.

### IPv6 Support

The official nginx image checks for the existence of `/proc/net/if_inet6` and automatically listens on `[::]:80` if it exists. For simplicity, Chainguard's `nginx` container image only listens on IPv4, but you can add IPv6 support by mounting a configuration file with a section similar to the following:

```
server {
    listen       8080;
    listen  [::]:8080;
    ...

```

Note that the default configuration file in the Chainguard `nginx` Container includes the relevant section at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`. 

### Environment Variable Substitution

The official nginx image has support for setting environment variables that get substituted into the config file. Currently we do not have support for this.

### User Directive Warning

Starting the container gives the following warning:

```shell
 [warn] 1#1: the "user" directive makes sense only if the master process runs with super-user privileges, ignored in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:2
```

This warning tells us that the container is already running as the user `nginx`, meaning that the directive has no effect because the default user is already `nginx`. If the container is run as root, it would switch to the `nginx` user to run the `nginx` process. We've included this directive in the default configuration for those running the container with a different user using the `--user` flag or equivalent.

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint for the `nginx` Chainguard Container is `/usr/sbin/nginx`. Commands run as part of `docker run` or a `CMD` statement in a Dockerfile will be passed as arguments to `nginx`.


## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> For a hands-on example of how to use the `nginx` container image, we encourage you to check out our guide on [Getting Started with the nginx Chainguard Container](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started/nginx/).

The `nginx` Chainguard Container provides a secure basis for serving static content, running a reverse proxy, or performing other common server tasks. To try out the image, run:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest
```

After starting the container, navigate to `localhost:8080` in your web browser. You should find the default nginx welcome page.

You can also use the `nginx` Container to serve your own custom content. As an example, first create a folder to contain static HTML that will be served by nginx:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/html
```

Next, create a file called `index.html` in the `html` folder:

```shell
cat > ~/html/index.html <<EOF
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>nginx</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Hello World from nginx!</h2>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

You can then instruct the nginx Image to serve the `index.html` file:

```shell
docker run \
 -v $(pwd)/html:/usr/share/nginx/html \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest
```

If you navigate to `localhost:8080` in your web browser, it will return our custom HTML: `Hello World from nginx!`.

## Adding a Custom Server Block

The default nginx configuration file checks for custom server blocks as files with a `.conf` extension within the `/etc/nginx/conf.d` folder. As an example, let's create a minimal server block that will serve the `index.html` file in the `html` folder created above from a new location (`/www/data`) and from a new port (`4000`).

Create a folder to hold our block configuration:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/conf.d
```

Create a new server block configuration file within this folder:

```shell
cat > ~/conf.d/static.conf <<EOF
server {
  listen        4000;

  location / {
    autoindex on;
    root  /www/data;
  } 
}
EOF
```

The above is a server block that will be loaded within the default nginx configuration file. Static files will be served from the `/www/data` location at port `4000`.

The following command runs an nginx container, adding our `html` folder and the `conf.d` configuration folder as volumes

```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
 -v $(pwd)/html:/www/data \
 -v $(pwd)/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d \
 cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest
```

The above will serve our HTML from the `/www/data` folder on port `4000` using the additional settings defined in the default `nginx.conf` file.

## Replacing the Default nginx Configuration

To replace the main nginx configuration file, you can mount a folder containing a configuration file named `nginx.conf` at `/etc/nginx/` within the container.

First create a folder to contain our replacement configuration:

```shell
mkdir -p nginx-conf
```

Create a configuration file inside this folder:

```shell
cat > ~/nginx-conf/nginx.conf <<EOF
worker_processes  auto;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    sendfile        on;

    server {
      listen        4000;

        location / {
            autoindex on;
            root  /www/data;
  } 
}

}
EOF
```

Start a container with our created `html` and `nginx-config` folders as volumes.


```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
 -v $(pwd)/html:/www/data \
 -v $(pwd)/nginx-conf:/etc/nginx \
 cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest
```

You should be able to view the contents of the `index.html` file in the `html` folder at `localhost:4000`. For more on nginx configuration, refer to the [documentation at nginx.org](https://nginx.org/en/docs/example.html).

## Run in a read-only File System

If you want to serve files using a read-only filesystem, you will need to mount the `/var/run` and `/var/lib/nginx/tmp` directories. You can do this with the `--tmpfs` option:

```shell
docker run \
 --read-only \
 --tmpfs /var/lib/nginx/tmp/ --tmpfs /var/run/ \
 --cap-drop=ALL \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx
```

You can also run the `nginx` container image in a read-only filesystem using Kubernetes. To do so, you could use a manifest like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
	matchLabels:
  	app: nginx
  template:
	metadata:
  	labels:
    	app: nginx
	spec:
  	containers:
  	- name: nginx
    	image: cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest
    	ports:
    	- containerPort: 8080
    	securityContext:
      	readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    	volumeMounts:
    	- name: run
      	mountPath: /var/run/
    	- name: tmp
      	mountPath: /var/lib/nginx/tmp/
  	volumes:
  	- name: run
    	emptyDir: {}
  	- name: tmp
    	emptyDir: {}
  	- name: conf
    	configMap:
      	name: nginx-conf
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
