<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Image
The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/graalvm-native:latest
```
<!--getting:end-->

<!--body:start-->
## Using


This image includes `glibc` and `libz`, and is designed to contain exactly what's needed to run GraalVM native-image binaries.

This image is meant to be used as a base image only, and is otherwise useless.  It contains the `wolfi-baselayout-data` package from Wolfi, which is just a set of data files needed to support glibc static binaries at runtime.

## Users

The image has a single user `nonroot` with uid `65532`, belonging to gid `65532`.
