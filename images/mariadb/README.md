# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) is one of the most popular open source relational databases.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Using MariaDb

The default MariaDB port is 3306.
To run with Docker and allow empty passwords:

```sh
$ docker run -p 3306:3306 --rm -e MARIADB_ALLOW_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=1 cgr.dev/chainguard/mariadb

Mon Jan 23 03:47:20 UTC 2023 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Initializing database files


PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:

'/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

## Users and Directories

By default, this image runs as a non-root user named `mysql` with a uid of 65532.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to create a new database and user upon initialization, and also to set up the root account password.

- `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Sets the password for MariaDB's root superuser account. If this variable is not set, you'll need to use either `MARIADB_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD` or `MARIADB_ALLOW_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD` in order to initialize the database successfully.
- `MARIADB_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`: A non-zero value sets up a random password for the root superuser account.
- `MARIADB_ALLOW_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD`: A non-zero value allows for an empty root password.
- `MARIADB_DATABASE`: Creates a new database upon initialization.
- `MARIADB_USER`: Together with `MARIADB_PASSOWORD`, this environment variable can be used to create a new database user and grant them full access to the database defined by `MARIADB_DATABASE`.
- `MARIADB_PASSWORD`: This should be used in conjunction with the `MARIADB_USER` environment variable to set up the database user's password.

## Docker Compose Example

This `docker-compose.yaml` sets up a MariaDB database with a default database and user. Other services can be added to create a local multi-node environment for development and tests.

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  mariadb:
    image: cgr.dev/chainguard/mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MARIADB_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: yes
      MARIADB_USER: user
      MARIADB_PASSWORD: password
      MARIADB_DATABASE: test
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    networks:
      - wolfi

networks:
  wolfi:
    driver: bridge
```
<!--body:end-->

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
