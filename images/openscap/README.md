# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

NIST Certified SCAP 1.2 toolkit

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

The Chainguard `openscap` image is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the upstream [OpenSCAP toolkit](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap).

## Getting Started

To retrieve information about a SCAP data stream, run a command like the following:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/openscap:latest info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-chainguard-gpos-ds.xml
```
```
Document type: Source Data Stream
Imported: 2025-06-12T21:40:52
Stream: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_all-resolved-xccdf-v3r2.xml
[... additional document information ...]
```

If you have SCAP content files that you want to evaluate, you can first create a directory to store the files:

```shell
mkdir -p scap-content
```

Then evaluate SCAP content by mounting the content directory. In the following example, we run an evaluation on the file /scap-content/your-oval-file.xml..."

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/scap-content:/scap-content \
  cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/openscap:latest \
  oval eval --results /scap-content/results.xml /scap-content/your-oval-file.xml
```

> [!NOTE]
> Many security scanning operations require elevated privileges or access to host system information. Consider using `--privileged` or specific capability flags when performing system scans.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
