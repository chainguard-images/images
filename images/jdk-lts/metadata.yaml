    ### Upcoming Changes

    On August 12, 2024 this image will be removed to be consistent with our other images which only make
    the latest version available. We recommend you move to use the [jdk image](../jdk/README.md). Note
    that this image uses a different version of Java, which may require changes to your build system or
    application.

    Full details are in [this blog post](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/updates-to-lts-images-in-chainguard-images-developer-tier).
