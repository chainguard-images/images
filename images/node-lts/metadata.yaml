    ### Upcoming Changes

    On August 12, 2024 this image will be removed to be consistent with our other images which only make
    the latest version available. We recommend you move to use the [node image](../node/README.md). Note
    that this image uses a different version of Node.js, which may require changes to your build system or
    application.

    Full details are in [this blog post](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/updates-to-lts-images-in-chainguard-images-developer-tier).
