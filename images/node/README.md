<!--overview:start-->
Minimal container image for running NodeJS apps
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Get It!
The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/node:latest
```
<!--getting:end-->

<!--compatibility:start-->
## Compatibility Notes

The image specifies a default non-root `node` user (UID 65532), and a working directory at `/app`, owned by that `node` user, and accessible to all users.

It specifies `NODE_PORT=3000` by default.

## Node Application Example

This brief example is derived from our [Getting Started with Node](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started/getting-started-node/) guide which is itself based on the [Docker Node example](https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/containerize/). It involves setting up an example Node application, building the application into a container image using the Chainguard Node Image, and then testing the newly-built image.

### Setting up an example application

You can set up our example Node application by cloning [the `node` directory](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/edu-images-demos/tree/main/node) from our [`edu-images-demos` repository](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/edu-images-demos).

```sh
git clone --sparse https://github.com/chainguard-dev/edu-images-demos.git
```

Because the Node demo application code is stored in a repository with other examples, we don’t need to pull down every file from this repository. For this reason, this command includes the `--sparse` option. This will initialize a sparse-checkout file, causing the working directory to contain only the files in the root of the repository until the sparse-checkout configuration is modified.

Navigate into the new directory.

```sh
cd edu-images-demos
```

To retrieve the files you need for this sample application, run the following `git` command.

```sh
git sparse-checkout set node
```

This modifies the sparse-checkout configuration initialized in the previous `git clone` command so that the checkout only consists of the repo’s `node` directory.

Navigate into the new `node` directory.

```sh
cd node/
```

From within this directory, run the following command to create a new `package.json` file:

```sh
npm init -y
```

Next, install the application dependencies. Specifically, you'll need `ronin-server` and `ronin-mocks`. These will create a "mock" server that saves JSON data in memory and returns it in subsequent GET requests to the same endpoint.

```sh
npm install ronin-server ronin-mocks
```

### Building the application image

After setting up the application, it can be built into a container image using the Dockerfile included in the example repository.

This Dockerfile will perform the following actions:

1. Start a new image based on the `cgr.dev/chainguard/node:latest` image;
2. Set the work dir to `/app` inside the container;
3. Copy application files from the current directory to the `/app` location in the container;
4. Run `npm install` to install production-only dependencies;
5. Set up additional arguments to the default entrypoint (`node`), specifying which script to run.

Build the application image with the following command:

```sh
docker build . -t wolfi-node-server
```

### Testing the application

Once the build is finished, run the image:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 wolfi-node-server
```

Although the application is running from within a container, this command will cause it to block your terminal we set up a port redirect to receive requests on `localhost:8000` as the application waits for connections on port `8000`.

From a new terminal window, run the following command. This will make a POST request to your application sending a JSON payload:

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/test \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"msg": "testing node wolfi image" }'
```

If the connection is successful, you will receive output like this in the terminal where the application is running:

```sh
2023-02-07T15:48:54:2450  INFO: POST /test
```

You can now query the same endpoint to receive the data that was stored in memory when you run the previous command:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/test
```
```sh
{"code":"success","meta":{"total":1,"count":1},"payload":[{"msg":"testing node wolfi image","id":"6011f987-b9f8-4442-8253-d54166df5966","createDate":"2023-02-07T15:57:23.520Z"}]}
```

When you're finished, you can close the application by pressing `CTRL+C` (`CMD+C` if you're using macOS).
