## Compatibility Notes

Where possible, the Go Chainguard Image is built for compatibility with the [Docker official image for Golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/). 

Unlike most other Chainguard images, the Go image contains a shell; namely, Bash. The reason for this is that this image is meant to be used as a build image, not a runtime image. The Go binary itself isn't very useful, so the Go Chainguard image contains Bash, along with tools like `make` and `gcc`, to allow users to build binaries.

The Go Chainguard Image uses the `glibc` implementation of the C standard library, while the Alpine version of the Golang official Docker Image uses `musl`. See our [article on glibc vs. musl](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl/) on Chainguard Academy for an overview of the differences between these implementations.

When using the Chainguard Go image, we advise to use shared linking and the `glibc-dynamic runtime` image as static linking of C/C++ code can often create dark matter and invade scanners. As an alternative, we recommend using the `static` image as the runtime image, as it still provides CA certs for TLS. If using `go-msft-fips`, we recommend using `glibc-openssl-fips`.

The examples in this README recommend executing Go binaries from one of our runtime Chainguard Images, such as the `glibc-dynamic` or `static` Chainguard Images. If using the `static` Chainguard Image, make sure to build your Go binary with static linking. In most cases, this requires running `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` when building the binary. If dynamic linking is needed, use the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image or the Go Chainguard Image to run your application. 

In Go 1.20, we default to using the new `GODEBUG` settings of `tarinsecurepath=0` and `zipinsecurepath=0`. These can be disabled by clearing the `GODEBUG` environment variable, or by setting them to `1`.

Learn more about these settings in the [Go release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20).

## Getting Started

### Example: CLI Application Using Multi-Stage Build

The following build demonstrates a command line application with support for flags and positional arguments. The application prints a modifiable greeting message and provides usage information if the wrong number of arguments are passed by a user or the user passes an unrecognized flag.

First, create a project folder and change the working directory to that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/go-greeter && cd $_
```

Next, ,write a file defining our Go CLI application (`main.go`:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > main.go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func usage() {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "usage: hello [options] [name]\n")
	flag.PrintDefaults()
	os.Exit(2)
}

var (
	greeting = flag.String("g", "Hello", "Greet with `greeting`")
)

func main() {
	// Configure logging
	log.SetFlags(0)
	log.SetPrefix("hello: ")

	// Parse flags.
	flag.Usage = usage
	flag.Parse()

	// Parse and validate arguments.
	name := "Linky üêô"
	args := flag.Args()
	if len(args) >= 2 {
		usage()
	}
	if len(args) >= 1 {
		name = args[0]
	}
	if name == "" { // hello '' is an error
		log.Fatalf("invalid name %q", name)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%s, %s!\n", *greeting, name)
}
EOF
```

Create a go.mod` file to list dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > go.mod
module chainguard.dev/greet

go 1.19
EOF
```

Write a `Dockerfile` to define our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && go build -o go-greeter .

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static
COPY --from=builder /app/go-greeter /usr/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/go-greeter"]
EOF
```

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build approach, compiling the application using the `go` Chainguard Image, then copying the binary to the `static` Chainguard Image for execution. Note that the `static` image requires that the Go binary be statically linked‚Äîif your application requires dynamic linking, consider using the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image for your runtime (see the second example in this README).

Build the image, tagging it `go-greeter`:

```sh
docker build . -t go-greeter
```

Run the image:

```sh
docker run go-greeter
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Hello, Linky üêô!
```

You can also pass in arguments that will be parsed by the Go CLI application: 

```sh
docker run go-greeter -g Greetings "Chainguard user"
```

This will produce the following output:

```
Greetings, Chainguard user!
```

The application will also share usage instructions when prompted with the `--help` flag or when invalid flags are passed.

Because we used the `static` Chainguard Image as our runtime, the final image only requires a few megabytes on disk:


```sh
docker inspect go-greeter | jq -c 'first' | jq .Size | numfmt --to iec --format "%8.4f"
```

The final size, `3.5055M`, is orders of magnitude smaller than it would be running the application using a Go image. However, if your application is dynamically linked to shared objects, consider using the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image for your runtime or take extra steps to build your Go binary statically.

### Example: Web Application

The following build demonstrates an application that's accessible by HTTP server. The application renders a simple message that changes based on the URI.

First, create a project folder and change the working directory to that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/greet-server && cd $_
```

Next, write a `main.go` file defining our web application:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > main.go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"html"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"runtime/debug"
	"strings"
)

func usage() {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "usage: helloserver [options]\n")
	flag.PrintDefaults()
	os.Exit(2)
}

var (
	greeting = flag.String("g", "Hello", "Greet with `greeting`")
	addr     = flag.String("addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "address to serve")
)

func main() {
	// Parse flags.
	flag.Usage = usage
	flag.Parse()

	// Parse and validate arguments (none).
	args := flag.Args()
	if len(args) != 0 {
		usage()
	}

	// Register handlers. for greeting and version
	http.HandleFunc("/", greet)
	http.HandleFunc("/version", version)

	log.Printf("serving http://%s\n", *addr)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(*addr, nil))
}

func version(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	info, ok := debug.ReadBuildInfo()
	if !ok {
		http.Error(w, "no build information available", 500)
		return
	}

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<pre>\n")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s\n", html.EscapeString(info.String()))
}

func greet(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	name := strings.Trim(r.URL.Path, "/")
	if name == "" {
		name = "Linky üêô"
	}

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!DOCTYPE html>\n")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s, %s!\n", *greeting, html.EscapeString(name))
}
EOF
```

Next, write a `go.mod` file listing dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > go.mod
module chainguard.dev/greet-server

go 1.19
EOF
```

Write a `Dockerfile` to define our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && go build

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=builder /app/greet-server /usr/bin/

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/greet-server"]
EOF
```

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build approach, compiling the application using the `go` Chainguard Image, then copying the binary to the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image to serve.

Build the image, tagging it `greet-server`:

```sh
docker build . -t greet-server
```

Run the image:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 greet-server
```

Visit [http://0.0.0.0:8080/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/) using a web browser on your host machine. You should see the following:

```
Hello, Linky üêô!
```

Changes to the URI will be routed to the application. Try visiting [http://0.0.0.0:8080/Chainguard%20Customer](http://0.0.0.0:8080/Chainguard%20Customer). You should see the following output:

```
Hello, Chainguard Customer!
```

The application will also share version information at [http://0.0.0.0:8080/version](http://0.0.0.0:8080/version).

If you're building a web application with Go, consider the [nginx](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/nginx/overview) Chainguard Image for use as a reverse proxy.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
