# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Container image with only busybox and libc (available in both musl and glibc variants). Suitable for running any binaries that only have a dependency on glibc/musl.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Upcoming Changes

On July 15, 2024 the `busybox:latest` image will move from a Alpine base to a Wolfi base,
in-line with all other images in our registry. We do not expect this to cause breakages, but
encourage all users to test and verify the new version.

You can test today by migrating to the `cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest-glibc` image. From July 15, the `:latest` and `:latest-glibc` will point to the same image.

Full details are in [this blog post](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/changes-to-static-git-and-busybox-developer-images).

## Usage

Chainguard offers two different variations of the `busybox` Image. Both contain the BusyBox software but are built against different variants of `libc`:

- `latest`, meant for variants based on `musl`
- `latest-glibc`, meant for variants based on `glibc`

You can ensure that either of these Images are working correctly by testing that they can run commands and return output. The following commands will both return `hello world!` in your terminal:

`musl`:
```shell
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest echo hello world!
```

`glibc`:
```shell
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest-glibc echo hello world!
```

Also, note that you can open an interactive shell on either version of the Image with command like the following:

```shell
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest sh
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
