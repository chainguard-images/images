# static


Base image with just enough files to run static binaries!

This image is meant to be used as a base image only, and is otherwise useless.  It contains the `alpine-baselayout-data` package from Alpine, which is just a set of data files needed to support glibc and musl static binaries at runtime.

This image can be used with `ko build`, `docker`, etc, but is only suitable for running completely static binaries, such as with `go build` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`. See [musl-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/musl-dynamic) and [glibc-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/glibc-dynamic) for images with the C standard library included.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest
```

## Usage

Here's an example Dockerfile that builds a Rust static binary
and puts it into the static image:

```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=x86_64 rust:alpine as build

RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello"); }' > hello.rs
RUN rustc --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl hello.rs

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```
To build and run it:

```bash
$ docker build -t rusty-cgr --file examples/Dockerfile.rust .
...
$ docker run rusty-cgr
Hello
```

Note the size!

```bash
$ docker images rusty-cgr
REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
rusty-cgr       latest    aff4c01fd4f0   6 minutes ago   6.09MB
```
And a C static binary:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM gcc:latest as build

COPY <<EOF /hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf("Hello!"); }
EOF
RUN cc -static /hello.c -o /hello

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```

To build and run it:

```bash
$ docker build -t c-cgr -f examples/Dockerfile.c .
...
$ docker run c-cgr
Hello!
```

It's even smaller:

```bash
$ docker images c-cgr
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
c-cgr        latest    f3648380711c   About a minute ago   2.88MB
```

For Go programs, we recommend using [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) and setting
the `defaultBaseImage` to `cgr.dev/chainguard/static`.

## Users

The image has a single user `nonroot` with uid `65532`, belonging to gid `65532`.
