# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimal image with kubectl binary.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

The `kubectl` Chainguard Image provides a low-to-zero CVE environment for [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) suitable for integrating into Kubernetes CI or testing workflows.

## Configuration

To load your own global configuration file, you can set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and mount a configuration file on your host machine to the specified location on the container using a volume.

The command below sets the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to `.kube/config` within the `nonroot` home folder, initializes a volume at that location, and runs the container with a command that prints the current configuration.

```sh
docker run \
 -e KUBECONFIG=/home/nonroot/.kube/config \
 -v $PWD/config:/home/nonroot/.kube/config \
 cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/kubectl:latest-dev config view
```

Make sure to replace `ORGANIZATION` with the name of your organization.

If you would prefer to test this command without using your own configuration file, you can create a default `config` file in your current working directory as below:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > config
apiVersion: v1
clusters: null
contexts: null
current-context: ""
kind: Config
preferences: {output=json}
users: null
EOF
```

## Getting Started

### Adding to a Kubernetes Cluster

In this example, we'll add the Kubectl Chainguard Image to a Kubernetes cluster. To follow this example, you'll need to install the following software to your host machine:


- [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#installation). 
- [`chainctl`](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainctl-usage/how-to-install-chainctl/)
- [`kubectl`]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Once the `kind` utility for creating local Kubernetes clusters is installed and on your path, create a new cluster with the following command:

```sh
kind create cluster
```

This will create a cluster with the default name `kind`.

Next, we'll need to download a pull token using Chainguard's [`chainctl`](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainctl-usage/how-to-install-chainctl/) utility. This will allow us to access your organization's Chainguard Images in environments that do not support OIDC, such as a Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following to generate a pull token:

```
chainctl auth configure-docker --pull-token --save
```

You will need to select your organization name from the menu and confirm the creation of the pull token. This will save your pull token to your Docker configuration, typically at `~/.docker/config.json`.

Now use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) on your host machine to load the pull token as a secret. The following assumes your current working directory is your home directory, and depending on your system and configuration you may need to update the path to the `config.json`.


```
kubectl create secret generic cgsecret \
 --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./.docker/config.json \
 --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Next, we'll run a shell command to create a configuration for the pod for our `kubectl ` Chainguard Image container. 

Run the following command to create the pod configuration file:


```sh
cat << EOF > kubectl.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kubectl-container
    image: cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/kubectl
    command: ["/usr/bin/kubectl", "version"]
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: cgsecret
EOF
```

The above provides configuration for a pod that will pull the `kubectl` Chainguard Image from your organization, then run a container with a command that outputs the current `kubectl` version.

Run the following to create the pod using the configuration file:

```sh
kubectl create -f kubectl.yaml
```

The pod should now be created. Run the following command to see information on the pod and associated container:

```sh
kubectl describe pod kube-pod
```

```
Name:             kube-pod
Namespace:        default
Priority:         0

    Port:          <none>
    Host Port:     <none>
    Command:
      /usr/bin/kubectl
      version
    State:          Waiting
      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff
    Last State:     Terminated
      Reason:       Completed
      Exit Code:    0
...
```

In the configuration file, we provided the `/usr/bin/kubectl version` command. The above output shows this command completed. We can view the output of the command:

```sh
kubectl logs kube-pod
```

```
Client Version: v1.31.3
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
Server Version: v1.30.0
```

The `kubectl` Chainguard Image has now been loaded into the cluster and used to run a command. To access cluster information from the container, you will need to [configure a security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for the pod or container.

Once you're finished testing, you can shut down and delete the example `kind` cluster with the following command:

```sh
kind delete cluster
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
