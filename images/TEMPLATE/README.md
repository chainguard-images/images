This is a template for creating configs for new images.

Include a brief description of the image here, and instructions about how to use it.

When you're done, run `monopod readme` to update the top section of this file, and update the root README.md file.

To get started, run:

```sh
cp -R images/TEMPLATE images/[new-image-name]
```
