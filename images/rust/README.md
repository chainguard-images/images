# Chainguard Image for rust

Minimal Wolfi-based Rust image for building Rust applications.

Chainguard Images are regularly-updated, minimal container images with low-to-zero CVEs.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Image
This image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/rust:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard registry.

- [Provenance Information](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/rust/provenance_info/)

This image contains the tools needed to build Rust code.
This includes:

* `rustc`
* `cargo`
* `rustdoc`
* `rustlldb`
* And more!

This image also includes a shell for compatibility with most `cargo` package installations.
This image **is not** intended to be used as a runtime image, only as a build tool.

### Rust Version
This will automatically pull the image to your local system and execute the command `rustc --version`:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/rust --version
```

You should get output similar to this:

```
rustc 1.67.1 (d5a82bbd2 2023-02-07) (built from a source tarball)
```

## Application Setup for End Users

For runtime, you can use a multi-stage Dockerfile or similar technique to run your compiled binaries on
an even more slimmed down image.
The exact image will depend on your application, but `static` or `glibc-dynamic` should work.

This sample Dockerfile shows how to get a basic build up and running on `glibc-dynamic`.
There's one build argument, `PACKAGE`, that needs to be replaced with the name of your rust package.

```Dockerfile
ARG PACKAGE=myapp

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/rust as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=build --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app/target/release/${PACKAGE} /usr/local/bin/${PACKAGE}
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/${PACKAGE}"]
```

```shell
$ docker build -t foo --build-arg PACKAGE=shop .

## What are Chainguard Images?

[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=readmes) are a collection of container images designed for security and minimalism.

Many Chainguard Images are [distroless](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started-distroless/); they contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These images do not even contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview), our Linux _undistro_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Images include:

* Minimal design, with no unnecessary software bloat
* Automated nightly builds to ensure Images are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) (software bills of materials) attesting the provenance of all artifacts within the Image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds))

### `-dev` Variants

As mentioned previously, Chainguardâ€™s distroless Images have no shell or package manager by default. This is great for security, but sometimes you need these things, especially in builder images. For those cases, most (but not all) Chainguard Images come paired with a `-dev` variant which does include a shell and package manager.

Although the `-dev` image variants have similar security features as their distroless versions, such as complete SBOMs and signatures, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. The general recommendation is to use the `-dev` variants only to build the application and then copy all application artifacts into a distroless image, which will result in a final container image that has a minimal attack surface and wonâ€™t allow package installations or logins.

That being said, itâ€™s worth noting that `-dev` variants of Chainguard Images are completely fine to run in production environments. After all, the `-dev` variants are still **more secure** than many popular container images based on fully-featured operating systems such as Debian and Ubuntu since they carry less software, follow a more frequent patch cadence, and offer attestations for what they include.
