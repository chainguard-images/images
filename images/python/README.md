## Download this Image
The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
```
<!--getting:end-->

## Description

The `python` Chainguard Image provides a minimal Python runtime suitable for workloads such as web applications, CLI utilities, interfacing with APIs, or other tasks.

## Variants

We have two image variants available:

- A `python:latest-dev` variant that contains the `pip` and `apk` package managers and the `bash`, `ash`, and `sh` shells.
- A minimal runtime variant that removes shells and package managers for additional security.

To pull the minimal runtime variant from `cgr.dev`:

```sh
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
```
To pull the dev variant:


```sh
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

## Usage Notes

The entrypoint for the `python` Chainguard Image is `/usr/bin/python`. Commands run as part of `docker run` or a `CMD` statement in a Dockerfile will be passed as arguments to `python`.

To access the shell in the `python:latest-dev` image, you'll need to include an `--entrypoint` option, as in the following example.

```sh
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

Also note that the `python` image uses the `nonroot` user by default. To perform operations such as installing packages with `apk`, run the image as root.

```sh
docker run -it --user root --entrypoint /bin/bash chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

We recommend against using the root user in a production environment.

## Packages

If you require additional packages that can be installed with the `pip` package manager, we recommend using a multistage build. This process involves installing packages in a virtual environment using the `latest-dev` variant, then copying this environment over to the minimal runtime image. 

The following is a minimal example of a Dockerfile that uses a multistage build to run an `app.py` script after installing dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev as dev

WORKDIR /app

RUN python -m venv venv
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin":$PATH
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py app.py
COPY --from=dev /app/venv /app/venv
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin:$PATH"

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
```
