# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimal Wolfi-based Java JDK image using [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/).  Used for compiling Java applications.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

Like most available alternatives, Chainguard's JDK image is built directly from the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/). The Chainguard JDK image has few-to-zero CVEs and does not run as the root user.

## Getting Started

The JDK is the standard development system for a Java application. It is used for compiling and packaging Java applications, which are then run on a JRE.

### Compiling a Minimal Java Application Example

This section outlines how you can build a Java application with the Chainguard JDK Image.

Start by creating a sample Java class named `HelloWolfi`:

```sh
cat >HelloWolfi.java <<EOL
class HelloWolfi
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Wolfi users!");
    }
}
EOL
```

Then create a multistage Dockerfile, adding the Java class you just created:

```sh
cat >Dockerfile <<EOL
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/jdk

COPY HelloWolfi.java /home/build/
RUN javac HelloWolfi.java

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/jre

COPY --from=0 /home/build/HelloWolfi.class /app/
CMD ["HelloWolfi"]
EOL
```

Following that, you can build the image:

```sh
docker build -t my-java-app .
```

Note that this example tags the image with `my-java-app`. You can now run the image by referencing this tag, as in the following command:

```sh
docker run my-java-app
```
```
Hello Wolfi users!
```

### Using the Chainguard JDK image in a Jenkins Pipeline

Using a Chainguard Image as part of a CI/CD system like Jenkins might also be a useful option. With the Jenkins Docker agent, you can define multiple steps that use different Chainguard Images. The following is an example using the Chainguard JDK image as part of a Jenkins pipeline:

```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'cgr.dev/chainguard/jdk' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                # Use javac, jdeps, jlink, ...
                sh 'javac -version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For a full reference on using various images in a Jenkins pipeline, please refer to the [Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/).

### Using the Chainguard JDK to create a custom JRE

A less common, but powerful, use case for the JDK image is creating an optimized custom JRE for your Java application. This involves using `jdeps` to produce the information about the Java modules being used and subsequently using `jlink` to analyze your application to eliminate all module code not being used by your application. This can create a drastically smaller JRE for a particular application.

Keep in mind that a JRE produced this way is a fit-for-purpose JRE, and is not broadly usable.

For reference, here are two additional articles describing the use of `jlink` to create optimized application images:

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
