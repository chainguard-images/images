# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimal Wolfi-based Rust image for building Rust applications.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

- [Documentation](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/rust)
- [Provenance Information](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/rust/provenance_info/)

This image contains the tools needed to build Rust code.
This includes:

* `rustc`
* `cargo`
* `cargo-auditable` wrapper
* `rustdoc`
* `rustlldb`
* `rust-audit-info`
* And more!

This image also includes a shell for compatibility with most `cargo` package installations.
This image **is not** intended to be used as a runtime image, only as a build tool.

### Rust Version
This will automatically pull the image to your local system and execute the command `rustc --version`:

```shell
docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/rust --version
```

You should get output similar to this:

```
rustc 1.67.1 (d5a82bbd2 2023-02-07) (built from a source tarball)
```

### Cargo Auditable

By default `/usr/local/bin/cargo` contains a wrapper to always call `cargo auditable` which generates and embeds build time crate information in the compiled binaries. This enables inspecting compiled rust binaries with `rust-audit-info` which is also included in this image. Many security scanners also know how to parse this information for the purpose of detecting security vulnerabilities. For more information see [Cargo Auditable](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-auditable?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo-auditable) project.

Building without audit information is possible by invoking `/usr/bin/cargo` directly, however doing that will evade scanner support in the resulting binaries.

## Application Setup for End Users

For runtime, you can use a multi-stage Dockerfile or similar technique to run your compiled binaries on
an even more slimmed down image.
The exact image will depend on your application, but `static` or `glibc-dynamic` should work.

This sample Dockerfile shows how to get a basic build up and running on `glibc-dynamic`.
There's one build argument, `PACKAGE`, that needs to be replaced with the name of your rust package.

```Dockerfile
ARG PACKAGE=myapp

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/rust as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=build --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app/target/release/${PACKAGE} /usr/local/bin/${PACKAGE}
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/${PACKAGE}"]
```

```shell
$ docker build -t foo --build-arg PACKAGE=shop .

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
