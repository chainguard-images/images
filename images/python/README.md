# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimal Python image based on Wolfi.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Description

The `python` Chainguard Image provides a minimal Python runtime suitable for workloads such as web applications, CLI utilities, interfacing with APIs, or other tasks.

### Experimental JIT

Starting with our Python 3.14 image, you can activate the experimental
free-threaded JIT by exporting `PYTHON_JIT=1` before launching `python`:

```sh
export PYTHON_JIT=1
python ...
```

Python uses its standard interpreter when launched without the `PYTHON_JIT`
environment variable being set to 1. No additional binary or image is required.

You can verify that the JIT is operating by examining the `sys._jit` module:

```py
import sys

assert sys._jit.is_available
assert sys._jit.is_enabled
assert sys._jit.is_active
```

## Variants

We have two image variants available:

- A `python:latest-dev` variant that contains the `pip`, `uv`, and `apk` package managers and the `bash`, `ash`, and `sh` shells.
- A minimal runtime variant that removes shells and package managers for additional security.

To pull the minimal runtime variant from `cgr.dev`:

```sh
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
```
To pull the dev variant:


```sh
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

## Usage Notes

The entrypoint for the `python` Chainguard Image is `/usr/bin/python`. Commands run as part of `docker run` or a `CMD` statement in a Dockerfile will be passed as arguments to `python`.

To access the shell in the `python:latest-dev` image, you'll need to include an `--entrypoint` option, as in the following example.

```sh
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

Also note that the `python` image uses the `nonroot` user by default. To perform operations such as installing packages with `apk`, run the image as root.

```sh
docker run -it --user root --entrypoint /bin/bash chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

We recommend against using the root user in a production environment.

## Packages

If you require additional packages that can be installed with the `pip` package manager, we recommend using a multistage build. This process involves installing packages in a virtual environment using the `latest-dev` variant, then copying this environment over to the minimal runtime image.

The following is a minimal example of a Dockerfile that uses a multistage build to run an `app.py` script after installing dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev as dev

WORKDIR /app

RUN python -m venv venv
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin":$PATH
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py app.py
COPY --from=dev /app/venv /app/venv
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin:$PATH"

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
