## Using Vault K8s

The Chainguard Vault k8s image contains the [vault-k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-k8s) binary. The binary contains various
intergrations for Kubernetes and Vault, including the Vault Agent Sidecar Injector.
This is a drop-in replacement for the Hashicorp [vault-k8s image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault-k8s). 

This image is intended to be used alongside the [Chainguard
Vault](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/vault) image. See the [Vault
image docs](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/vault#helm-chart-usage) for
information on how to run these images with the [Hashicorp Helm Chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm).

You can also run this image standalone e.g:

```shell
$ docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/vault-k8s
Usage: vault-k8s [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
    agent-inject    Vault Agent injector service
    version         Prints the version
```
