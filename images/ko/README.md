This is an image that contains ko, go, and build-base.

This image is designed for use in situations where you would like to use `ko` with codebases that have C dependencies where `cgo` must be used. In these cases, staticly linking against musl instead of glibc results in smaller binaries.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/ko:latest
```

# Usage

### Using with CGO

Navigate to the `example/` directory:

```
cd example/
```

Then run:

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/work \
  --workdir=/work \
  -e KO_DOCKER_REPO=example.com \
  -e CGO_ENABLED=1 \
  cgr.dev/chainguard/ko build ./ \
    --push=false \
    --preserve-import-paths
```

This will build the example program, but not push it, due to `--push=false`.

To push, you will need to mount in your Docker config to provide auth by adding:

```
  -v $DOCKER_CONFIG:/docker-config \
  -e DOCKER_CONFIG=/docker-config \
```

If you're using Docker credential helpers, those will need to be made available in the container as well so that `ko` can invoke them.
