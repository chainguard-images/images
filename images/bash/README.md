# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Container image with only Bash and libc. Suitable for running any small scripts or binaries that need Bash instead of the BusyBox shell.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

The Chainguard Bash image is meant to serve as a drop-in replacement for the official Bash image from Docker Hub. One notable difference between the Docker Hub image and Chainguard's Bash image is the location where `bash` is installed in the container. The Bash Image from Docker Hub has `bash` installed at `/usr/local/bin/bash` while Chainguard's has it installed at the standard `/bin/bash`.

Like most of Chainguard's images, the Bash image does not operate as the root user and includes only the minimum packages needed to function. 

## Getting Started

To open up an interactive shell in the Bash Image you could run a command like the following:

```sh
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/bash:latest /bin/bash
```

To test scripts from your local machine on the Bash image, you can use a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/). The following example references a local script named `local-script.sh`, binds it to the container while renaming it `container-script.sh`, and then runs the script:

```sh
docker run -v /path/to/local-script.sh:/container-script.sh cgr.dev/chainguard/bash:latest /container-script.sh
```

You can also test scripts on the Bash image using a Dockerfile. The following example Dockerfile references a Bash script named `test-script.sh`:

```
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/bash:latest

COPY test-script.sh /

CMD ["bash", "/test-script.sh"]
```

You could then build an image based off this Dockerfile:

```sh
docker build -t my-bash-app .
```

And then run the new image to test the script:

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-bash-app
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
