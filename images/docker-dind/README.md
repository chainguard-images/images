# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Chainguard image for Docker in Docker (DinD), allowing you to run Docker within a container.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.
<!--overview:end-->

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes
The Chainguard Docker Image is comparable to [the official Docker Image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker). However, the Chainguard image contains only the minimum set of tools and dependencies needed to function. This means it doesn't include things like a package manager.

## Getting Started

To use the image you can either run in privileged mode after mounting sock path or run the image with --privileged flag
As an example of how you can use this image, run the container in detached mode by passing the `-d` argument and bind the Docker socket:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name my-dind $IMAGE_NAME sh
```

Following that, you can interact with the container using `docker exec`:

```shell
docker exec -it my-dind docker info
docker exec -it my-dind docker version
docker exec -it my-dind docker images
docker exec -it my-dind docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox echo "Hello from BusyBox"
```
Another example of how you can use this image, run the container in privileged mode by passing the `--privileged` flag:
```shell
docker run --name my-privileged-dind --rm --privileged -d $IMAGE_NAME
```

Following that, you can interact with the container using `docker exec`:

```shell
docker exec -it my-dind docker info
docker exec -it my-dind docker version
docker exec -it my-dind docker images
docker exec -it my-dind docker run --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox echo "Hello from BusyBox"
```

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
