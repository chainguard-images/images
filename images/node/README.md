## Compatibility Notes

Where possible, the Node Chainguard Image is built for compatibility with the [Docker official image for Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

The Node Chainguard Image runs as a nonroot user (`node`) by default. A `USER root` statement may be required before performing tasks requiring elevated permissions.

## Getting Started

### Example: Distroless CLI Application

In this example, we'll write a `.js` script that prints a message, then prints the message reversed. The script will use one dependency, the [`text-reverse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-reverse) package. The script will optionally take one positional argument‚Äîif no argument is passed, a default message will be printed and reversed, otherwise the passed argument will be printed and reversed.

First, let's create a project structure for our example:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/node-reverse/bin && cd ~/node-reverse
```

This creates the following folder structure and sets our working directory to the root `node-reverse`folder:

```
node-reverse
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
```

Now let's create a `package.json` file, which provides metadata about the project, including dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > package.json
{
    "name": "linky_hello",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Say hello to Linky",
    "main": "bin",
    "bin": {
        "linky_hello": "./bin/index.js"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "text-reverse": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
EOF
```

The above defines a package, `linky_hello`, that depends on `text-reverse`, and which whill run the code in `bin/index.js` on `npm run start`.

Let's create our application code now:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > bin/index.js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const reverse=require('text-reverse');

const run_argument=process.argv[2]

if (run_argument) {
    console.log(run_argument)
    console.log(reverse(run_argument))    
} else {
    const message="Hello, Linky!"
    const reversed=reverse(message)
    console.log(message  + "üêô")
    console.log("üêô" + reversed)
}
EOF
```

This application code first looks at any arguments passed to the script. If a positional argument is passed when the script is run, it will print that argument, then print its reverse. If no argument is passed, a default message will be printed and reversed.

Finally, let's create a `Dockerfile` for our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/node:latest
ENV NODE_ENV=production

WORKDIR /app

COPY --chown=node:node package.json .
ADD ./bin ./bin
RUN npm install

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "bin/index.js"]
EOF
```

This `Dockerfile` sets the `file NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`, copies our `package.json` and `bin` directory, installs our dependency with `npm install`, and runs our `.js` script.

Build the image, tagging it `node-reverse`:

```sh
docker build . -t node-reverse
```

Finally, run the container:

```sh
docker run node-reverse
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, Linky!üêô
üêô!ykniL ,olleH
```

You can also pass an argument to the `docker run node-reverse` command to change the output:

```sh
docker run node-reverse "Hello, Chainguard User\!"
```

This should produce the following output:

```
Hello, Chainguard User!
!resU draugniahC ,olleH
```

## Example: Express.js Server

In this example, we'll create an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server that allows retrieval of a JSON-formatted list of animals and the addition of new animals via POST request.

First, create a folder for our example:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/node-express && cd $_
```

Create a `package.json` file, which provides metadata about the project, including dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > package.json
{
  "name": "Express Server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A server that allows getting and posting dummy data in JSON format",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.14.1",
    "express": "^4.13.3"
  }
}
EOF
```

Next, add our server application code:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > server.js
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = express();

//Allow all requests from all domains
app.all('/*', function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, GET");
  next();
});

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));

var animals = [
    {
        "id": "234kjw",
        "text": "octopus"
    },
    {
        "id": "as82w",
        "text": "penguin"
    },
    {
        "id": "234sk1",
        "text": "whale"
    }
];


app.get('/animals', function(req, res) {
    console.log("GET From SERVER");
    res.send(animals);
});

app.post('/animals', function(req, res) {
    var animal = req.body;
    console.log(req.body);
    animals.push(animal);
    res.status(200).send("Successfully posted animal\n");
});

console.log("üêôüêßüêã Server running. Retreive animals from http://localhost:6069/animals")
app.listen(6069);
EOF
```

Finally, create a `Dockerfile` for our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/node
ENV NODE_ENV=production

WORKDIR /app

COPY --chown=node:node ["package.json", "server.js", "./"]

RUN npm install --omit-dev

CMD [ "server.js" ]
EOF
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker build . -t node-express
```

Finally, run the server container:

```sh
 docker run --rm -p 6069:6069 node-express
```

You should see the following message:

```
üêôüêßüêã Server running. Retreive animals from http://localhost:6069/animals
```

Visit [http://localhost:6069/animals](http://localhost:6069/animals) to view the served JSON data.

You can post new data to the running application:

```sh
 curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{ "id":9001,"text":"gnu"}' \
 -X POST \
 http://localhost:6069/animals
```

After posting, refresh the page on [http://localhost:6069/animals](http://localhost:6069/animals) to view the additional data.

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
