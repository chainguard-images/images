# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

[Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Expression Language, and WebSocket technologies.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

<!--getting:start-->
## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

The Chainguard Apache Tomcat image is meant to serve as a drop-in replacement for the official Tomcat image.

Like most of Chainguard's images, this image does not operate as the root user and includes only the minimum packages needed to function.

## Getting Started

To start up the `tomcat` server:

```shell
docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/tomcat:latest
```

This shows you the Apache Tomcat log output as the server boots, so you can check for any errors and confirm that Tomcat is running.

If you are running this container on your local machine for testing, you can modify the original `docker run` by forwarding requests to a port on your host machine to one of the container's ports. This enables you to connect to the Tomcat server using your host computer's browser:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 cgr.dev/chainguard/tomcat:latest
```

This again shows the Apache Tomcat log output as the server boots.

Now browse to `http://localhost:8080` to see an Apache Tomcat 404 error page. Tomcat will return a 404 error because, by default, Tomcat ships with an empty `webapps` directory. Regardless, what you will see is a confirmation that the Tomcat server is running.


## Documentation and Resources

You can find the official Tomcat documentation on [the Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
