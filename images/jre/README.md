# Chainguard Container for REPO_NAME

Minimalist Wolfi-based Java JRE image using [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/). Used for running Java applications.

Chainguard Containers are regularly-updated, secure-by-default container images.

## Download this Container Image
For those with access, this container image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/ORGANIZATION/REPO_NAME:latest
```

Be sure to replace the `ORGANIZATION` placeholder with the name used for your organization's private repository within the Chainguard Registry.

## Compatibility Notes

Like most available alternatives, Chainguard's JRE image is built directly from the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/). The Chainguard JRE image has few-to-zero CVEs and does not run as the root user.

## Getting Started

A JRE is the standard runtime for a Java application and is used for running an already developed and packaged Java application. Generally, you will combine your application with the Chainguard JRE image and Docker or a build tool like [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

### Using Jib to build a JRE-based application image

Using Maven or Gradle, you can compile and package your application. [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master) is a tool from Google Container Tools which builds optimized Docker and OCI images for Java applications. It's available as a plugin for both Maven and Gradle, as well as a Java library. 

The Jib GitHub repository includes [a useful example application](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/examples/spring-boot) that works with Maven or Gradle.

### Using Helm to Deploy your Java Application

Using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to deploy your JRE-based application image is relatively straightforward using either [this Kubernetes Service Helm Chart](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/main/charts/k8s-service/README.md) or [this Service Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/kvalitetsit/service) from ArtifactHub.

The latest builds of Chainguard's JRE image pass the TCK for OpenJDK Java 21.0.3 and Java 22.0.1 as provided by [OpenJDK Community TCK License Agreement](https://openjdk.org/legal/openjdk-tck-license.pdf) (OCTLA) and are [Java Compatibility Kit (JCK) conformant](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/chainguards-openjdk-java-images-are-now-jck-conformant).

## What are Chainguard Containers?

Chainguard's free tier of Starter container images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview?utm_source=readmes), our minimal Linux _[undistro](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro)_.

All other Chainguard Containers are built with [Chainguard OS](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-os/overview/?utm_source=readmes), Chainguard's minimal Linux operating system designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a more secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimal design, without unnecessary software bloat
* Daily builds to ensure container images are up-to-date with available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/?utm_source=readmes) attesting to the provenance of all artifacts within the image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/?utm_source=readmes)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds?utm_source=readmes))

For cases where you need container images with shells and package managers to build or debug, most Chainguard Containers come paired with [a *development*, or `-dev`, variant](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/).

In all other cases, including Chainguard Containers tagged as `:latest` or with a specific version number, the container images include only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These minimal container images typically do not contain a shell or package manager.

Although the `-dev` container image variants have similar security features as their more minimal versions, they include additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. We recommend using multi-stage builds to copy artifacts from the `-dev` variant into a more minimal production image.

## Need additional packages?

To improve security, Chainguard Containers include only essential dependencies. Need more packages? Chainguard customers can use [Custom Assembly](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) to add packages, either through the Console, `chainctl`, or API.

To use Custom Assembly in the Chainguard Console: navigate to the image you'd like to customize in [your Organization's list of images](https://console.chainguard.dev/images/organization), and click on the **Customize image** button at the top of the page.
